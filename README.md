# 64Inject

Injector for Nintendo 64 Wii U Virtual Console.

64Inject was born as a personal use project, but soon I escalate to something much more ambitious however much of the code retained some of the bad programming practices of its origins (especially in error handling) so I do not recommend the use of this code.

I used "64Inject" as a base to create "[Phacox's Injector]( https://github.com/phacoxcll/PhacoxsInjector)" by changing a lot of code to improve error handling and incorporate more "injectors". That is why I have abandoned the development of "64Inject" in favor of "Phacox's Injector" which retains the same functionality and adds many more for other Wii U Virtual Consoles.
